                Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the
                blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
                ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It
                is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the
                all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day
                however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of
                Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
                Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven
                versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of
                the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the
                headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question
                ran over her cheek, then
